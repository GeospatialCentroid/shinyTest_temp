EnviroScreen Score,NA,generated June 2022,Score value,"County, Census Tract, Census Block Group","The EnviroScreen Score combines population characteristics and environmental burdens. The score goes from 0 to 100, with the highest score representing the highest burden.
The EnviroScreen score is a percentile, which is like a ranking. The number represents how many of the state's counties, census tracts, or census block groups have a lower score than the area in question.
Suppose a county has an EnviroScreen score of 70. This means its EnviroScreen score is higher than 70% of all counties in Colorado. In other words, 70% of counties in Colorado are less likely to be affected by environmental health injustices than the selected county. 
Suppose a census tract has an EnviroScreen score of 20. This means its EnviroScreen score is higher than 20% of all census tracts in Colorado. In other words, 20% of counties in Colorado are less likely to be affected by environmental health injustices than the selected census tract, or 80% of census tracts in Colorado are more likely to be affected by environmental health injustices than the selected census tracts."
Pollution and Climate Burden Score,NA,generated  June 2022,Score value,"County, Census Tract, Census Block Group","The Pollution and Climate Burden score combines the scores from the following components: Environmental Exposures, Environmental Effects, and Climate Burden.
