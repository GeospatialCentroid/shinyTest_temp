## About the Colorado EnviroScreen project

[https://cdphe.colorado.gov/enviroscreen](https://cdphe.colorado.gov/enviroscreen)

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) and a team at Colorado State University are gathering pre-launch feedback on an enhanced environmental health screening tool for Colorado. This interactive mapping tool is called Colorado EnviroScreen. The tool will launch in early summer.

Colorado EnviroScreen will enable users to identify disproportionately impacted (DI) communities based on the definition in Colorado’s Environmental Justice Act (HB21-1266) so that communities directly benefit from:

- Money and other resources. For example, the Environmental Justice Advisory Board at CDPHE will use EnviroScreen to determine where to distribute environmental justice grants created by the new law.
- Enhanced opportunities to participate in Air Quality Control Commission rulemaking and permitting decisions. 
- Priority for emissions reductions during climate-related air quality rulemakings.
- Enhanced emissions monitoring and modeling for air pollution permits.
- Priority for enforcement and compliance initiatives under an agreement between CDPHE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
